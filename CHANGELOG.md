## Update 1: 4PM Apr 4
- The teacher changes the ```set``` file. Update completed.
## Update 2: 7.40 PM Apr 4
1. The PC class is completed.
2. However, we aren't sure about the following: In the ```@DomainConstraint``` comment, is it ```type = "Integer"``` ot ```type = "int"```?
3. Simillarly, do we need to add **other** attributes, such as ```min```, ```max```, ```length```?
## Update 3: 9:10 PM Apr 4
- The PCFactory class is a singleton, so there's only 1 line: create a PC object. However, we're tasked with creating **multiple PC**. So, a for loop? (Ask the teacher)
